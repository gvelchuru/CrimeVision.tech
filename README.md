# CrimeVision.Tech

This project is a proof-of-concept web page designed to allow users to easily examine historical crime data, predict future crime hotspots, and find safe spots to park their cars. 

We use the Seattle Police Database to create crime heatmaps, as well as (expand about ML). The green-hued areas represent historic data, where the blue-heud represent predicted. 
Further, we use the Google Maps Places API, and the Liberty Mutual Shine API to find parking areas, and parking meters, respectively. Red dots represent meters, while blue represent parking areas.
